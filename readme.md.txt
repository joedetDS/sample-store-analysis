# Sample Store Analysis

## Introduction

In this analysis, I will explore the sample store dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/filizesenkaya/sample-store), a well-known dataset for data analysis. This dataset contains a wide range of features, including order ID, country, region, price, quantity, discount, profit, and many others. I have selected a subset of 100 records from the dataset and will perform various data analysis tasks to gain insights into the data.

## Objective

This analysis seeks to pinpoint the underlying causes of recent financial losses by identifying which year, category, and sub-category of products had the most losses. The ultimate goal is to develop effective strategies to address these issues while safeguarding customer satisfaction and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the company.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset provides information about a variety of transactions in the sample store, encompassing different regions, products, and order details. Each record includes details such as order ID, country, city, product category, sub-category, sales, quantity, discount, profit, and more.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure.
   - Handling missing values, outliers, and data cleaning tasks.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzing the distribution of key variables.
   - Identifying trends and patterns within the dataset.

3. **Loss Analysis:**
   - Identifying the years, categories, and sub-categories with the most significant losses.
   - Investigating potential factors contributing to the losses.

4. **Strategy Development:**
   - Formulating strategies to address identified issues and mitigate future losses.
   - Balancing the need for profitability with maintaining customer satisfaction.
